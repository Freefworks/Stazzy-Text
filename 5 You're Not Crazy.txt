You're Not Crazy

It's an international problem.
It's called EMF (Electro Magnetic Field) and voice to skull.
EMFs and voice to skull can't be eliminated, but there are counter measures.

1. Make sure your house is grounded with copper wire.

2. Put a steel pipe with copper wire coiled around it inside of a pot or a bucket of potted soil and use it as a lightning rod for the EMFs to go into. 
You can build as many of these as necessary.

3. There is Anti EMF clothing and Anti EMF paint you can purchase on the internet.

4. When in doubt, keep in mind these metals that can be used to conduct EMFs away from you: Copper, Brass, Aluminum, Gold, and Nickel.

5. If possible, make sure the frame of your house isn't made out of iron or steel. 
If it is, consider moving to a safer location. 
I understand that the house market sucks and money is tight, so don't worry about this measure if you can't afford it.

Remember, the EMFs and voice to skull are separate from your appliances and that anywhere you go in the globe will be EMFs and voice to skull.
Keep living your life, don't panic, try some of the counter measures and see how much your situation improves.
