Salvation

It's only the blood of Jesus Christ that paid for your sins so that you don't go to Hell.
Just like Jesus saved me from my estranged father, so too, can Jesus save you from burning in Hell.
Why do you work when the work is already finished?
The truth is, Jesus doesn't need you.
You need Jesus.
He is calling out to you in love.
He is extending out the olive branch to you.
Will you accept his free gift of eternal life?
Or will you forever burn in the fires of Hell, in the absence of the Father?
Is eternal darkness and fiery torment really what you want to experience after you die?
Come as you are.
