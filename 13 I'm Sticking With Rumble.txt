I'm Sticking With Rumble

Here are the reasons why:
1. I already have a system that works with Rumble.
2. I can't properly embed Peertube videos on Stazzy Station.
3. My family can watch my videos on the TV with Rumble.
4. I don't want to maintain a web server.
5. I don't have the storage space for my own Peertube instance.

Thank you for your time and understanding.
If plans change in the future, I'll let you know.
