Happy Enemy Identification Month!

Faggots and slags are pathetic nags.

He who raises the flag, will be put in the bag.

I wish all gays a slow and painful leprosy.

You will reap what you have sown.

Psalms 103:9 KJV

“He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.”
