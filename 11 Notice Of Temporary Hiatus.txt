Notice Of Temporary Hiatus

I'm switching from Windows 11 to Linux Mint Cinnamon.
I have no idea how long I will be gone for.
I want to be fully comfortable with creating media on Linux before I return to uploading files on Stazzy Station.
I am also considering switching from Rumble to Peertube.
Is this finally the year of the Linux desktop?
Probably not, but when Windows 12 comes around...
Actually owning my PC and peace of mind are worth more than any convenience.
I will let you know if the switch went smoothly after I'm finished.
Keep an eye out for one of these titles in the future:
"Huzzah! Liberty At Last!"
Or
"Fuck! I'm Stuck!"
I'll see you guys again in the future.
I'm desperately hoping and praying that I get to post that first headline instead of the second one.
