Current Status Of Bumper 64 2

I will continue to use version 1.0 of Mario Builder 64 to finish
creating levels for Bumper 64 2.

Version 1.1 will be used to build new levels in future projects.

Version 1.1 will also be used to test old levels to make sure they still work exactly as intended.

Production of Bumper 64 2 levels will resume shortly after I am finished updating all of the character art on Stazzy Station.

Thank you for your time.
