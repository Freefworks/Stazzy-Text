Digital Art On Linux

For anyone still struggling with curved lines, use the spline tool in Inkscape.
(Create Bspline path).
I now use Inkscape for my line art and FireAlpaca for my coloring, shading and highlighting.
Honestly, Gimp and Krita suck donkey balls.
I regret recommending them.
Please don't use them unless you want to have a bad time.
On the bright side, I can now create line art blazing fast and I can color, shade and highlight at the same speed that I used to.
For anyone used to PaintToolSAI, I wholly recommend FireAlpaca.
It's the closest thing you're going to get.
If you ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO use PaintToolSAI, you can always use WINE to emulate it.
I'm sorry it took so long for me to fully get the art situated, but we're finally here.
I hope you guys enjoy Moon Man.
He was created solely on Linux without using WINE.
All parts and functions of Stazzy Station are now fully operational.
Hooray!
